If you still confused about what is OpenJDK binary distribution, read this https://www.azul.com/blog/what-is-openjdk/[post].

I will guide you in installing Eclipse Temurin version 17, which is the latest LTS version, on Windows 10.
From the start till you could run Java command on Windows Command Prompt.

== Download and Install Eclipse Temurin

First, get the Eclipse Temurin installer from the https://adoptium.net[Adoptium Website].
The download button will choose installer based on your Operating System.
So, make sure to download *.msi* installer.

When the progress is done, the *Completed Setup Wizard* window will show up.
Click _Yes_ to confirm.

Now, you already have installed Eclipse Temurin 17.
You could verify with open the _Command Prompt_ and executing below command:

[source, shell]
----
java --version    <1>
javac --version   <2>
----

<1> Check the Java Runtime Version.
<2> Check the Java Compiler Version.

== Setup %JAVA_HOME%

The only thing that missing from Eclipse Temurin is it does not set up _%JAVA_HOME%_ for you.
So, if you're using Apache Maven or Gradle on _Command Prompt_ you will have an error.
Here is an example from Apache Maven when _%JAVA_HOME%_ is missing

[source, shell]
____
C:\Users\anadr>mvn --version
The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not defined correctly
This environment variable need to run this program
NB: JAVA_HOME should point to a JDK, not a JRE
____

You could set up the _%JAVA_HOME%_ with the below steps:

=== Open Edit Environment Variable

Now, you can verify the _JAVA_HOME_ and _java_ command on your _Command Prompt_.
