:jbake-spoiler: An introduction to Nayanika, picture viewer application.
:jbake-prism:

Dear readers, nice to meet you.
My name is Sukma Wardana, a Java developer from Indonesia.

My day job is as a back-end developer.
I build a service that consumes, produces, or often does both.

I've spent most of my day times batling in consoles to read logs produced by my services.
When you doing this for almost 5 years.
Believe me, you will feel bored.

So, during my free time, I will learn something different.
I will create a project during my learning journey.
But, most of them will be buried on my machine or deserted on my Github repository.

But, not today!

I have a goal to see my side-project launch.
Seeing someone use my side-project of course is what I want.
But, in meantime, I'm content with being the only user.

== Introduce Nayanika

My side-project name is _Nayanika_ a picture viewer desktop application.

Before I continue, I need to **emphasize** that my side-project is not ready, yet.
I decided that I want to develop it and share the journey.

And this will be the first page of my journey on building it.

Well, actually I already make the application ready to use around last year.
But, I found something is not fit.
So, I decided to archive it and start from the beginning.

The reason why I abandon it and created it again from the beginning will be on a different story.

=== Background

During my teenager, I love reading.
I would read anything.
But, my interest is in graphic books such as comics and mangas.

I must make a confession.
That I consumed piracy comics and mangas during my teenager.
But, it's stopped when I have a job and steady income.
I would buy it legally either the print edition or digital edition.

Now, let's back again when I mention consuming piracy comics and mangas.
Often time, the piracy comics and mangas are a bundle of images.
At that time, I'm a Windows 7 Home edition user.
I use the built-in _Windows Photo Viewer_ application to read the comics and mangas.

I'm a happy user of Windows Photo Viewer.

=== Everything is Ephemeral

Sadly, Windows Photo Viewer is only last on Windows version 7.
When you upgrade to Windows 8 onwards, what you will get is Microsoft Photos.

But, I'm not the only one who loved Windows Photo Viewer.
Because there is a https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-restore-and-use-windows-photo-viewer-in-windows-10[hack on bring back the Windows Photo Viewer on Windows 10].

Windows Photo Viewer is clearly abandoned by Microsoft.
Using hack to bring it back is wrong.
It's like bringing back something that has already been forgotten back to life.
You can't complain if it's buggy.
Or the performance is not on par during its golden time.

== Picture Viewer Preferences

Do I try different applications?
Yes, I do.
But, it's limited to the built-in app on the Operating System itself.
I have tried Windows Photo on Windows 10, Gweenview from KDE, and Preview from Mac OS.

My reason to build my own application, Nayanika, is because _nothing checked all of my boxes, so I am building one myself_.
Welcome to open-source.

=== Building for Desktop

I prefer to read my comics and mangas with my laptop.
First, I prefer a larger monitor to read rather than using my smartphone.
Second, I spent most of the time in front of my laptop.
Decided from the beginning that Nayanika is for desktop applications.

Today, Windows is not only my primary Operating System.
I have used macOS and Linux often too.
I know this is a luxury to be able to experience the three big operating systems.
But, this luxury makes me want to develop Nayanika able to run on those three operating systems.

Nayanika is a desktop application and must be able to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

=== Keyboard Centric

Being a desktop application, I didn't want it to depend solely on clicking with the mouse.
It must support the keyboard shortcut for triggering an action.
If possible, the keyboard shortcut must be the first-class citizen on the application.

Thus, documenting keyboard shortcuts for Nayanika is on the to-do list.
I'm still debating whether the user could re-mapping the shortcut or not.
But, in the beginning, all the shortcuts will be defined and can't be re-mapped.

== Technologies

Making a desktop application that is able to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
This is already a daunting task for me.
I have never had experience in building a desktop application.
I'm not good at designing _User Interface_ (UI) that have great _User Experience_ (UX).

But, I still want Nayanika to launch.

My technology choice is what I'm familiar with, Java.
I have 5 years coding with Java building backend services.
I know that Java could run anywhere as long as there JVM installed.
But the most important thing is Java has two great GUI Frameworks.
Which are Swing and JavaFX.

Swing is known as a stable GUI framework within Java worlds.
It's been bundled with _Java Development Kit_ (JDK) since 2007.
A real-world examples application built with Swing is the Java IDE.
Eclipse Java, Jetbrains Intellij, and Apache NetBeans are built with Swing.

While JavaFX is relatively new in the Java world.
Introduced at JavaOne 2007 then open-sourced in 2011.
Bundled with JDK in 2012, but decoupled in 2018 and until today it's become an independent project under https://openjfx.org[openjfx].
And for real-world examples, https://www.jfx-central.com/real_world[this] is the best source to check.

My better choice would be to use the Swing framework, but in the end, I choose JavaFX.
Even though JavaFX is still ongoing developed by https://gluonhq.com/services/javafx-support/[people who truly love JavaFX].
Rather than the stagnant Swing frameworks, I bet my GUI frameworks with JavaFX.

Fun fact, I have never worked with Java GUI before.
So, this will be an interesting learning process.

== Function Wishlist

Currently, this is my wishlist from a picture viewer application.
In a rough order of priorities for Nayanika, it is as follows:

=== High Priority

. Processing user local directory which pictures stored.
The first picture found will be displayed.
. Processing picture file from user local directory.
The picture will be displayed.
. Navigate next, previous, last, and beginning within the pictures.
. Zoom and Pan displayed picture.

=== Medium Priority

. Applied sorting on pictures.
. Slide-show animation.

=== Low Priority

. Support CBZ / CBR file.

I hope this provided you a general idea about what is Nayanika and my preferences.
Currently, the project is still on the initial process.
The project is open-source and source code is available at https://github.com/swardana/nayanika[Github].
